                <p>According to archaeologists, toilets already existed around the 25th century BC. At the time, men already used flush toilets. In Pakistan, for example, the toilets were already running on water and they are connected by drains surrounded
                    by bricks. In Mesopotamia, traces of sewers have also been discovered which, connected to pipes, served as an evacuation. were then used as fertilizer. In countries like India, it is a whole different story, as the needs are carried
                    out in nature, preferably near rivers or in the woods. For buildings or castles that had toilets, the excrement is dumped in the rivers, because there was not yet a septic tank.</p>
